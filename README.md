# IntelliJ-to-Eclipse-Formater

We are working in multiple teams ... some of us are using Intellij and some other Eclipse .... having different code formatiing which makes things hard ....

So i decided to create a plugin for it [ when and how is other thing ]

Let me know if you want to contribute.


#### That's a hard job really .... looking inside the generated fxmls .....

Have a look on differences between [Eclipse Code Formatter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goxr3plus/IntelliJ-to-Eclipse-Formater/master/ECLIPSE-FORMATTER.xml) and [IntelliJ Code Formatter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goxr3plus/IntelliJ-to-Eclipse-Formater/master/INTL-FORMATTER.XML)
